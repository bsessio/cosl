                                This section should be used to describe your character's personality. Try to aim for at least 200 words for a good, thorough description. Remember to use the <*p> code to create breaks between paragraphs! This section will scroll.

               <h1>Overarching Power or Ability</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>

                    eg, 'Pyrokinesis' 'Magnetism' etc. Please give a brief overview of their abilities in your own
                    words. Remember to use the "<*p>" and "<*/p>" code to create paragraphs! A character might have more
                    than one
                    overarching power or technology or indeed a mix of both. Copy and paste if more than one.

                        <hr>
                        <p>

                            eg, Flight, concussive attack. What does your character's overarching power set allow
                            them to do? You MUST quantify limitations. Endurance, upper power threshold, cost to the
                            character to use their ability, tonnage they can lift and situations that inhibit the
                            use of their powers are all examples of limitations. Set out as many secondary abilities
                            as apply.

                [*]This section should be used to elaborate on your character's history and should be done in
                bullet-point form.
                [*]First bullet should tell us about their upbringing and formative years, last bullet will bring us
                up to speed about current IC goals and motivations.
                [*]Some good footnotes to hit would be how they grew up, where they were when Loki invaded New York
                in 2012, how they came to their current location, joined their relevant faction, etc.
                [*]Remember to be concise and to write in third person.

                        This tab should be used to provide us with a sample of your writing abilities. We'd like at least
                400 words to give us a decent sample to review. Remember to use the "<*p>" and "<*/p>" code to create
                paragraph
                splits! This should be written in third person. This is the last section to complete. OOC info
